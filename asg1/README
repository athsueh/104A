This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner:  Richard Nicholson (rlnichol@ucsc.edu)
Partner:  Alan Hsueh (athsueh@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work in to
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

We spent       12 hours working together.

Please grade the work submitted by rlnichol@ucsc.edu

PLEASE IGNORE THE 109 FILES. I accidentally did a submit from the
wrong directory.
